Hi, I'm Billy. I'm doing my PhD in computer science with [Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj/) at Indiana University, focusing on deep learning and natural language processing.

My current research involves:

 - Long-context modeling
 - Efficient attention
 - Downstream evaluation of large language models and large multimodal models

I'm also interested in: 

 - Infrastructure for training on lots and lots and lots of gpus (e.g., [ultrascale-playbook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook), and [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-megatron-deepspeed))

I did my master's in computational linguistics at Indiana University with [Damir Cavar](https://damir.cavar.me/) in the [NLP Lab](https://nlp-lab.org/) working on applied NLP with knowledge graphs, ontologies, LLMs, and RAGs, and before that I did my bachelor's at Michigan State University where I studied linguistics, TESOL, Chinese, and Korean, and did a summer language program at Harbin Institute of Technology.
