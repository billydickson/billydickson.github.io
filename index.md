dicksonb [at] iu [dot] edu

PhD student in computer science at Indiana University with [Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj/).

Research Interests:

 - Long-context modeling, efficient attention, state-space models, hybrid models.
 - Evaluating multimodal large language models on human data.

Applied Interests:

 - NLP pipelines for adverse drug event detection and analysis.
 - RAGs, knowledge graphs, ontologies, agents.

Previously: 

I did my master's in computational linguistics at Indiana University with [Damir Cavar](https://damir.cavar.me/) in the [NLP Lab](https://nlp-lab.org/) working on time and event reasoning, and applied NLP with knowledge graphs, ontologies, LLMs, and RAGs, and did my bachelor's at Michigan State University where I studied linguistics, TESOL, Chinese, and Korean, and did a summer language program at Harbin Institute of Technology.
