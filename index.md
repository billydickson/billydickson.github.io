Hi, I'm a PhD student in computer science at Indiana University working with [Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj/).

I'm interested in:

 - attention, memory, long-context modeling
 - cognitively inspired model evaluations
 - learning about big huge gigantic llm training methodology, open models, model architecture, optimizers, parallelism techniques, pre-training

Sacred Texts:

 - [The Ultra-Scale Playbook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook)
 - [The Smol Training Playbook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceTB/smol-training-playbook)
 - [RLHF Book](https://rlhfbook.com/)
 - [Berserk](https://www.amazon.com/Berserk-Deluxe-1-Kentaro-Miura/dp/1506711987)

Previously I did a master's in computational linguistics at Indiana University with [Damir Cavar](https://damir.cavar.me/) in the [NLP Lab](https://nlp-lab.org/) working on time and event reasoning, and knowledge graphs and ontologies, and before that did my bachelor's at Michigan State University where I studied linguistics, TESOL, Chinese, and Korean, and did a summer language program at Harbin Institute of Technology.
