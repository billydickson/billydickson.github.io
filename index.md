Hi, I'm Billy. I'm doing my PhD in computer science with [Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj/) at Indiana University working on cognitively inspired deep networks. I'm particularly interested in utilizing cognitive models of human memory to improve large language models. ðŸ‘»

Previously, I did my master's in computational linguistics at Indiana University with [Damir Cavar](https://damir.cavar.me/) in the [NLP Lab](https://nlp-lab.org/) working on temporal and event reasoning, and before that I did my bachelor's at Michigan State University where I studied linguistics, Chinese, and Korean, and did a summer language program at Harbin Institute of Technology.
