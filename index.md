Hi, I'm a PhD student in computer science at Indiana University working with [Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj/).

I'm interested in:

 - attention, memory, long-context modeling, hybrid models, cognitive science
 - llm training methodology, architecture, open models, distributed training
 - prepretraining, pretraining, postprepreposttraining, mid-training

Previously I did a master's in computational linguistics at Indiana University with [Damir Cavar](https://damir.cavar.me/) in the [NLP Lab](https://nlp-lab.org/) working on time and event reasoning, and knowledge graphs and ontologies, and before that did my bachelor's at Michigan State University where I studied linguistics, TESOL, Chinese, and Korean, and did a summer language program at Harbin Institute of Technology.
