Hi, I'm Billy. I'm doing my PhD in computer science with [Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj/) at Indiana University, focusing on deep learning and natural language processing.

My current research involves:

 - Long context modeling with compressive memory
 - Evaluating large multimodal model inference capabilities
 - In-context learning 

I did my master's in computational linguistics at Indiana University with [Damir Cavar](https://damir.cavar.me/) in the [NLP Lab](https://nlp-lab.org/), and before that I did my bachelor's at Michigan State University where I studied linguistics, TESOL, Chinese, and Korean, and did a summer language program at Harbin Institute of Technology.
