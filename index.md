Hi, I'm a PhD student in computer science at Indiana University working with [Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj/).

Research Interests:

 - long-context modeling, hybrid models, linear attention, large multimodal models.

Applied Interests:

 - retrieval, knowledge graphs, ontologies, "context engineering".

Previously: 

I did a master's in computational linguistics at Indiana University with [Damir Cavar](https://damir.cavar.me/) in the [NLP Lab](https://nlp-lab.org/) working on time and event reasoning, and applied NLP with knowledge graphs and ontologies, and before that did my bachelor's at Michigan State University where I studied linguistics, TESOL, Chinese, and Korean, and did a summer language program at Harbin Institute of Technology.
