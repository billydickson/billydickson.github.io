Hi, I'm Billy. I'm doing my PhD in computer science with [Zoran Tiganj](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/ztiganj/) at Indiana University, focusing on deep learning and natural language processing.

My current research involves:

 - Investigating effects of incorporating compressive memory in LLMs during pre-training
 - Evaluating and comparing large multimodal model inference capabilities with humans

I think that scalable, general-purpose learning is enabled through introducing minimal inductive bias in models (see [The Bitter Lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html)), but I also find the [virtuous circle](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-and-neuroscience-a-virtuous-circle/) between AI and cognitive science can be a helpful guide when developing novel architectural innovations.

I did my master's in computational linguistics at Indiana University with [Damir Cavar](https://damir.cavar.me/) in the [NLP Lab](https://nlp-lab.org/), and before that I did my bachelor's at Michigan State University where I studied linguistics, TESOL, Chinese, and Korean, and did a summer language program at Harbin Institute of Technology.
